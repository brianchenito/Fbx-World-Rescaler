# Fbx-World-Rescaler
A utility that resizes scenes in FBX files without damaging skeletal animations.  Useful in correcting end of workflow scale issues- You 
finished your animation, but accidentally converted it from, say, inches to centimeters a few weeks ago. This allows you to keep your 
baked animations, or to resize a rigged mesh, without the weirdness that happens from directly scaling elements in scene.
